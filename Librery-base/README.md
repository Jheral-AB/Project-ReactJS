## Library project

# React hook

in this project, i used the hook 'useContext' and 'createContex' 
to handle the info of book globally,
and send the data between all component without the need 
to send props manually.

# React Router (react library)

with this library, i will configurate the route between my components

I find this project in youtube: (Vida MRR - Dise√±o y desarrollo web)
